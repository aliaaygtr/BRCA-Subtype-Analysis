#BRCA Subtype Analysis Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for compiling and analyzing BRCA (breast cancer) subtype data. The analysis focuses on classifying breast cancer subtypes using genomic data and includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and result visualization.
Notebook Contents
Data Loading: Importing BRCA datasets from TCGA or other relevant sources
Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing data, handling missing values
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant genomic features for subtype classification
Classification: Implementing machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
Validation: Cross-validation and performance metrics calculation
Visualization: Creating plots to interpret results and subtype distributions
Technical Requirements
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook/Lab
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow/pytorch
Expected Outputs
Classification performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Confusion matrix
Visualization of subtype distributions
Important feature rankings
Predicted subtype labels for samples
